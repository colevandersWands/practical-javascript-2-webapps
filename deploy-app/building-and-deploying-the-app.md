# Building and Deploying the App

Now that we have our application configured for proper building, we can actually execute the commands to make the build happen, and then to deploy the application. 

First, we must execute the build command:

```bash
npm run build
```

Since we made the changes to redirect output of the build process to the `docs/` directory, we should see that directory created.
