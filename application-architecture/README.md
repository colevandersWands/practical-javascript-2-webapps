# Application Architecture
As we become more savvy in building applications, it is possible for us to think in more advanced ways about how we are approaching the organization and management of the pieces of the application. This is something that always grows organically, no matter how experienced we become. 

In any project, we begin with a rough idea of what we hope to achieve, and we often don't have much more than that to go on. As we attempt to build solutions to the problems we are working to solve, we often discover much more knowledge about the problem, how best to approach it, and what it will take to deliver working software. From these improved understandings comes ideas of how to change and improve our application.

Within the world of software design, "refactoring" is the process of making structural improvements to existing code without changing the function of the code ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring)).
