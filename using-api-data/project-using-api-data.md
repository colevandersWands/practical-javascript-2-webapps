# Project: Using API Data

In this project, we will use the [Using APIs](https://github.com/suwebdev/wats4000-using-apis) repository as our starting point. This project asks us to create a rhyming thesaurus using the [Datamuse API](http://www.datamuse.com/api/). The Datamuse API is a wonderful tool that allows us to do all sorts of interesting look-ups to find suggested words. In this project, we will be looking for words that rhyme with one word (or phrase), but which also have some relation to another word (or phrase): a rhyming thesaurus. This is a tool that could be incredibly useful for poets, songwriters, battle rappers, and many others.

**Please note:** There are many features in the Datamuse API that can be used to create other types of applications ranging from avant garde algorithmic poetry to pragmatic, helpful writing tools. Feel free to explore the many possibilities of this free and open API.


## Review the Requirements

## Working the Project

## Wrapping Up

## Build and Deploy
Once we've finished our work, we can build and deploy the project. This project has been configured to build to the `docs/` directory, so we can follow the same pattern we used before:

1. Execute the `npm run build` command to build the files into the `docs/` directory.
2. Commit all of our code.
3. Push the code up to GitHub.
4. Go into the repository settings and set the GH Pages section to publish from the `docs/` directory.

The project should now be up and available to the public through GH Pages.

## Stretch Goals

There are many more fun things we can do with this project. The `README.md` file lists several possible stretch goals:

* Create a similar application using a different API. ([Find suggested APIs for experimenting with here](https://shawnr.gitbooks.io/practical-javascript-2-building-applications/appendices/appendix-b-api-suggestions.html).)
* Add a second API to this application and mingle the results in some interesting way
* Use the "score" data from the API to modify the visual presentation of the words to indicate which ones are the best matches for the user's search parameters
* Use the data returned from the API to modify the appearance or interface in some other way

There are many other ways we could push this forward. Feel free to explore and experiment with the many other features of the Datamuse API and all the things we can build with it.
