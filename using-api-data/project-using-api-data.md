# Project: Using API Data

In this project, we will use the [Using APIs](https://github.com/suwebdev/wats4000-using-apis) repository as our starting point. This project asks us to create a rhyming thesaurus using the [Datamuse API](http://www.datamuse.com/api/). The Datamuse API is a wonderful tool that allows us to do all sorts of interesting look-ups to find suggested words. In this project, we will be looking for words that rhyme with one word (or phrase), but which also have some relation to another word (or phrase): a rhyming thesaurus. This is a tool that could be incredibly useful for poets, songwriters, battle rappers, and many others.

**Please note:** There are many features in the Datamuse API that can be used to create other types of applications ranging from avant garde algorithmic poetry to pragmatic, helpful writing tools. Feel free to explore the many possibilities of this free and open API.
