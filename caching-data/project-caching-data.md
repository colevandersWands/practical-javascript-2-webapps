# Project: Caching Data

For this project, we will add some user information storage and caching to the weather application we refactored a couple sections ago. 

## Review the Requirements

## Working the Project

## Wrapping Up

## Build and Deploy
Once we've finished our work, we can build and deploy the project. This project has been configured to build to the `docs/` directory, so we can follow the same pattern we used before:

1. Execute the `npm run build` command to build the files into the `docs/` directory.
2. Commit all of our code.
3. Push the code up to GitHub.
4. Go into the repository settings and set the GH Pages section to publish from the `docs/` directory.

The project should now be up and available to the public through GH Pages.

## Stretch Goals
