# Core Concept: Methods of Storing Frontend Data

There are several methods made available to us for storing data on the frontend (in the browser). These include [cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies), [session storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage), [local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage/LocalStorage), [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API/Basic_Concepts_Behind_IndexedDB), and Web SQL (which is [deprecated](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webdatabase/websql-indexeddb/), so we won't be covering it). All of these technologies get wrapped up into the ["Storage"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage) concept in the browser, which seeks to unify the many methods of storing information on behalf of the user.
