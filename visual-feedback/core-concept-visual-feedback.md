## Meaningful Animations

One of the side-effects of writing highly performant Javascript applications is that when we change the data on the screen it can be difficult for users to notice the alterations. It's not at all uncommon when working with an unstyled app for even developers, bleary eyed from looking closely at code, may miss that a value has changed in a corner of the screen.

In order to make it more evident that changes are happening on the page, we often turn to animation. Humans are very good at noticing even small movements, especially if everything else on a page is generally stationary. We can animate position, size, color, and shape to help us draw attention to whatever we have changed.
