# Dynamic Classes
In Vue.js it is possible to bind the `class` attribute on an element to data values. This can allow us to more easily toggle class assignments from within our component logic. By altering the classes on components we can cause visual changes to happen when the user interacts or call the user's attention to some part of the interface.

## Binding Data to `class` attributes
toggle favorite/favorited

## Binding Data to `style` attributes
insert profile image into the background of an element
