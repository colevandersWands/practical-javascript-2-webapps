# Project: Bootstrap an App

To practice with making an application using the Vue-CLI tool, let's bootstrap an app that we can work with in sections 5 (Debugging the App) and 6 (Deploying the App) to practice working with the project skeletons we can create.

## Check for Vue-CLI
If we have Vue-CLI installed properly, then we can run the command `vue --version` from anywhere on our command line and see the version of the Vue-CLI that we have installed. We should see a number above `2.8`. If we see an error (something about the `vue` command not existing), then we should install Vue-CLI by running this command:

```
npm install -g vue-cli
```

## Bootstrap the Application
Once we have Vue-CLI properly installed, we can bootstrap our project skeleton. This will create all the files we need to get started writing our application.
