# Project: Templating Data

For this project, we will practice with some of the techniques used to output data in the template. We will use the [Templates and Data Starter Repository](https://github.com/suwebdev/wats4000-templates-and-data) to provide the data and basic application structure for this project.

As usual, the project repository defines a set of requirements that we must fulfill in order to complete this project. It's recommended to read through all of the directions before we begin working, and it might be preferable to work on the project before continuing to read through this section. If you become stuck, a full walkthrough of the project continues below.
