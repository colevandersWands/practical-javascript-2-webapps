# Using Forms in Vue.js

In Vue.js we can use forms to gather data from the user, and the form fields and events can easily be connected to our component logic. To accomplish this, we create bindings between the form fields and our component data. The `v-model` directive is how we assign these relationships. By binding fields to data values, we can do a lot directly in templates, or we can create event listeners and use component methods to perform actions when the form is submitted or when another event occurs.
