# Responding to User Input Part One
For this section's project, we will begin work on a small sequence of forms that we will finish out in the next section. [The starter repository for this project is located here](https://github.com/suwebdev/wats4000-multi-view-app). As usual, we will begin by forking the repository on GitHub into our own account, and then cloning the repository to wherever we are doing our development. Once we have the project cloned into our development environment, we are ready to get started.

## Review the Requirements
As with all of our projects, we begin by reviewing the `README.md` file in the root of the repository. This file will tell us the requirements we must fulfill in order to successfully complete this project. For this first part of the project, we will focus on the requirements outlined for the `Home.vue` file. We will finish the remaining requirements in the next section of the book (Routing and URLs).

In its entirety, this project asks us to create a couple of forms and move the user through multiple locations in the application to complete those forms. For this first part of the project, we will focus primarily on creating and validating the sign up form. When the user provides valid data, we will display a success message. If the user provides invalid data, we will display an error message.

The Basic Requirements for this project are broken into requirements for each of the files. Stretch goals are provided that apply to all of the work in this project. We are encouraged to push this experiment as far as possible, so adding or altering form fields, adjusting validation logic, and providing more textured error messages are all fair game for stretching this project in this section. (But remember, to fully complete the project we must complete the second part in the Routing and URLs section.)

## Working the Project 

## Wrapping it Up

## Build and Deploy
Once we've finished our work, we can build and deploy the project. This project has been configured to build to the `docs/` directory, so we can follow the same pattern we used before:

1. Execute the `npm run build` command to build the files into the `docs/` directory.
2. Commit all of our code.
3. Push the code up to GitHub.
4. Go into the repository settings and set the GH Pages section to publish from the `docs/` directory.

The project should now be up and available to the public through GH Pages.

## Stretch Goals

There are many more fun things we can do with this project. The `README.md` file lists several possible stretch goals:

* Enhance the sign up form to collect additional info, different info, or to use different input types to collect the data
* Enhance the validation to be more specific (e.g. verify no numbers in the name, or there is an `@` and a `.` in the email address, etc.)
* Enhance error messages to be more specific (e.g. build a message that mentions which field is causing the problem)

There are many other ways we could push this forward. Feel free to explore and experiment with forms and methods to handle user input. Keep pushing, and have fun!
