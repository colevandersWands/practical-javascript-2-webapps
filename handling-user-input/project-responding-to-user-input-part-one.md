# Responding to User Input Part One
For this section's project, we will begin work on a small sequence of forms that we will finish out in the next section. [The starter repository for this project is located here](https://github.com/suwebdev/wats4000-multi-view-app). As usual, we will begin by forking the repository on GitHub into our own account, and then cloning the repository to wherever we are doing our development. Once we have the project cloned into our development environment, we are ready to get started.

## Review the Requirements
As with all of our projects, we begin by reviewing the `README.md` file in the root of the repository. This file will tell us the requirements we must fulfill in order to successfully complete this project. For this first part of the project, we will focus on the requirements outlined for the `Home.vue` file. We will finish the remaining requirements in the next section of the book (Routing and URLs).

In its entirety, this project asks us to create a couple of forms and move the user through multiple locations in the application to complete those forms. For this first part of the project, we will focus primarily on creating and validating the sign up form. When the user provides valid data, we will display a success message. If the user provides invalid data, we will display an error message.

The Basic Requirements for this project are broken into requirements for each of the files. Stretch goals are provided that apply to all of the work in this project. We are encouraged to push this experiment as far as possible, so adding or altering form fields, adjusting validation logic, and providing more textured error messages are all fair game for stretching this project in this section. (But remember, to fully complete the project we must complete the second part in the Routing and URLs section.)
