# Responding to User Input Part One
For this section's project, we will begin work on a small sequence of forms that we will finish out in the next section. [The starter repository for this project is located here](https://github.com/suwebdev/wats4000-multi-view-app). As usual, we will begin by forking the repository on GitHub into our own account, and then cloning the repository to wherever we are doing our development. Once we have the project cloned into our development environment, we are ready to get started.
