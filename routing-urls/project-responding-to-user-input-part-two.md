# Project: Responding to User Input Part Two

In the previous section, we worked on the first part of [the Multi-View Application project](https://github.com/suwebdev/wats4000-multi-view-app). For this final part of the project, we should continue working on the repository we cloned in the last section. We will work a bit more with forms and explore how to set up simple routes in our application to provide bookmarkable locations for our users.

It's assumed that we've already forked, cloned, and set up our workspace. We should be able to continue from where we left off last time.

## Review the Requirements

## Working the Project

## Wrapping Up

## Build and Deploy
Once we've finished our work, we can build and deploy the project. This project has been configured to build to the `docs/` directory, so we can follow the same pattern we used before:

1. Execute the `npm run build` command to build the files into the `docs/` directory.
2. Commit all of our code.
3. Push the code up to GitHub.
4. Go into the repository settings and set the GH Pages section to publish from the `docs/` directory.

The project should now be up and available to the public through GH Pages.

## Stretch Goals

There are many more fun things we can do with this project. The `README.md` file lists several possible stretch goals:

* Add a navigation element to the `src/App.vue` template, and be sure to use the `router-link-active` class to style the current page link
* Add more pages of content to the site to practice creating new components from scratch and adding them to the routes Array

And it's still worthwhile to pursue the stretch goals from the previous portion of this project:

* Enhance the sign up form to collect additional info, different info, or to use different input types to collect the data
* Enhance the validation to be more specific (e.g. verify no numbers in the name, or there is an `@` and a `.` in the email address, etc.)
* Enhance error messages to be more specific (e.g. build a message that mentions which field is causing the problem)

There are many other ways we could push this forward. Feel free to explore and experiment with forms and methods to handle user input. Keep pushing, and have fun!
